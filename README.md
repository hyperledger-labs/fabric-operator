# fabric-operator

**fabric-operator** is an open-source, cloud-native [Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
for managing Hyperledger Fabric networks on Kubernetes. The operator follows the CNCF Operator Pattern,
reducing the minutia of performing repetitive, detailed configuration tasks to automated activities performed under
the guidance of software-based controllers.

Using the operator, a Fabric network is realized in a declarative fashion by applying a series of `CA`, `Peer`, 
`Orderer`, and `Console` resources to the Kubernetes API.  In turn, the controller executes a _reconciliation loop_, 
orchestrating containers, storage, and configuration to achieve the desired target state.

In nautical terms, fabric-operator serves as the _eXecutive Officer / XO_ of a vessel.  It
allows you, the captain, to invest valuable time and energy formulating strategic objectives for a blockchain 
deployment.  The operator, or XO, is responsible to enact the plan, and _"make it so."_ 

_Fabric, Ahoy!_

## Build a Fabric Network

- Build a [multi-org](sample-network-multi-org) network on a local KIND development cluster. 
- Build a [sample-network](sample-network) with Kube APIs.
- Build a Network with the [Fabric Operations Console](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-operations-console).
- Automate your network with [Ansible Playbooks](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-ansible-collection) and the Console REST APIs.
